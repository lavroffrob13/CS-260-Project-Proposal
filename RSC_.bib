abstract  ="We present a supervised learning approach to predict the products of organic reactions given their reactants{,} reagents{,} and solvent(s). The prediction task is factored into two stages comparable to manual expert approaches: considering possible sites of reactivity and evaluating their relative likelihoods. By training on hundreds of thousands of reaction precedents covering a broad range of reaction types from the patent literature{,} the neural model makes informed predictions of chemical reactivity. The model predicts the major product correctly over 85% of the time requiring around 100 ms per example{,} a significantly higher accuracy than achieved by previous machine learning approaches{,} and performs on par with expert chemists with years of formal training. We gain additional insight into predictions via the design of the neural model{,} revealing an understanding of chemistry qualitatively consistent with manual approaches."}
